# dqmc-python
Python implementation of the BSS algorithm.
Good for testing/benchmarking on small systems. 

Features:
---------
- stabilization exploiting the UDV stack (missing)
- time-displaced correlation functions (missing)
- arbitrary lattice geometries specified by a hopping matrix given as input file
